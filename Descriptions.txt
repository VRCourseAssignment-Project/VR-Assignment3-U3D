Master create the room will generate the obstacles
Client will not

Master will destroy the obstacles after disconnecting
Client will only destroy the player model prefab

we generate the obstacles by 4 different types and randomly initialize their location and combination by code.

How to play:
Movement: use arm swinging in order to navigate over the scene. To turn use head movement and point in desired direction.

Bonus:
We have implemented jumping to avoid obstacles. To jump: put your hands up (around the hmd).

To start the game: press the button X on Oculus, Menu on Vive.
To reset the starting position: press the button A on Oculus, Menu on Vive.
To jump: put your hands up (around the hmd).
